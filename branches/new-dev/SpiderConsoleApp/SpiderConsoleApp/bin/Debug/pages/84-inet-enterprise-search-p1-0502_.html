<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>The perennial question of what separates Enterprise Search from   the more familiar search engines that power the public Internet   recently came up again.&nbsp; Dr. Search was planning to do a blog   entry but <!--
  there were actually a number of differences, and the
  good doctor likes bullet points, so the text was reformatted.&#160;
  But then the list grew to well over 5 items, and old doc exclaimed
  &quot;Ah hah! this could be turned into one of those trendy
  'top 10' articles the bloggers like so
  much!&quot;&#160; But as you can see from the title, brevity was
  never doc's strong point. &#160;The
-->   the list mushroomed, and we now   present the first in a three part series on the dozens of things that   make Enterprise Search surprisingly difficult, and that sometimes   flummox the engines that were created to power the public web.</p>
<p>As we hinted above, the public Internet was the inspiration and   proving ground for a majority of the commercial and open source   search engines out there.&nbsp; Solving that technical problem,   indexing the Internet, has influenced both the architecture   and implementation, as engineers have made hundreds of assumptions about   data and usage patterns ??? assumptions that do not always apply   behind the firewalls of corporations and agencies.</p>
<p>When vendors talk about their products, features and patents, they   are usually talking about technology that was not specifically   designed for the enterprise.&nbsp; This isn't just   academic theory - as you'll see, these   assumptions can actually break enterprise search, if   not adjusted properly.</p>

            <p>We've divided our list into "technical   issues: user facing", "technical issues: back end data   and indexing", and then "business and strategic"   differences; we're doing the "easier" technical   stuff in the first two parts, with the strategic and biz stuff as the   finale.&nbsp; There's a bit of overlap, as some issues can be   viewed from both a business and technical perspective, and   data/indexing issues can affect what the user sees.&nbsp;   Of course not every item applies to every project and vendor,   "your mileage may vary".&nbsp; &nbsp;And heck, you may   already know some of these, but we're trying to be quite   comprehensive in scope, though perhaps a bit brief on some   items.&nbsp; If anything catches your eye, that you'd like more   details on, please drop us a note.&nbsp; And we've decided to   let you do your own "numbering", this isn't late   night TV after all.</p>

            <p class="h4">Defining "Enterprise" for this article</p>
            <p>To be clear, when we say "enterprise" search, we are referring to both the search engines that power private Intranets and Extranets, and to a lesser extent, the engines that companies have   purchased to power their commerce and customer facing web   sites.&nbsp; Broadly, "enterprise" search could be   thought of as "all search engines EXCEPT the public Yahoo,   Google and MSN", since you DO own and control the search engine   that powers your public web site or online store.&nbsp; And again,   your usage patterns and priorities are likely different from those of   the Internet portals.</p>
            <p>With all that said, let's get started!</p>

<h3>High Level Internet / Intranet Mismatches</h3>
<p>These are some differences viewed from the broadest 10,000   foot level.  We'll revisit some in more detail later.</p>
<p><small><a href="#top">[back to top]</a></small> <a name="smallint"></a></p>
<p class="h4">The Enterprise is not just "a small Internet"</h4>
<p>Imagine if you powered the Internet, and had a brand name that   rivaled Coca-Cola.&nbsp; And then, imagine if you took all of that   wonderful technological goodness with the wonderful brand name, and   stuffed it into a brightly colored rack-mounted box.&nbsp; You would   assume that, if you could handle the Internet, then of course you could   handle a relatively puny private network - it just makes sense!&nbsp;   You'd believe it, and so would your customers.&nbsp; To be   fair, this was Google a few years back; their v5 appliance has   clearly evolved beyond this simple model.</p>
<p>These seem like perfectly sane and compelling arguments, and this   model has worked at some companies.&nbsp; If your Intranet has a few   dozen (to a few thousand) company portals and departmental web sites,   which mostly contain HTML and PDF documents, this would possibly work   for you.</p>
<p>Or, suppose you had a portal that powered all of the Internet back   in the 1990s.&nbsp; Slap that software on a CD, give it a nice Web   based admin GUI, and ship it!&nbsp; This was actually the start of   several well known search vendors.&nbsp; These products have also   been iterated to add on enterprise functionality.</p>
<p>Ultraseek had been a great choice for more generic   enterprise environments, and included some customization.&nbsp;   Lately the Google Appliance is filling that segment, and can scale to   reasonable sizes.</p>
<p>In contrast, some engines were not created for the Internet, but   were always targeted at more specific business applications.&nbsp; As   an example, DieselPoint was created to serve complex parts databases   from its very beginning.&nbsp; It can also spider and search HTML and   other document formats, but that was not its genesis.</p>
<p><small><a href="#top">[back to top]</a></small> <a name="wpiwpo"></a></p>
<p class="h4">Not just WPIWPO and "Search Dial Tone"</p>
<p>We define generic search engines as "Web Pages In ???   Web Pages Out" (WPIWPO).&nbsp; Basically, a spider crawls and   indexes generic web content, and then the users run their searches   from generic web browsers (such as Internet Explorer, Firefox,   Safari, etc.).&nbsp; In the enterprise, however, content comes from   many other sources, such as Content Management Systems, databases and   archival storage appliances, etc.&nbsp; And users are not always   running searches from a web browser ??? more on that later.</p>
<p>When you have all the pages indexed and basic search up and   running, you have achieved "Search Dial-Tone".&nbsp;   Nothing fancy, but basic search functionality is online.</p>
<p><small><a href="#top">[back to top]</a></small> <a name="docvsdata"></a></p>
<p class="h4">Documents vs. Data</p>
<p>Modern search engines employ "fulltext" search,   looking for specific search terms in relatively unstructured   text.&nbsp; The unstructured nature of the data is the   key; it was assumed that most content would be composed of paragraphs   of text, with very little formal structure, verses the more   traditional fields in a database, with their more rigid INT, DATE and   CHAR datatypes.&nbsp; About the only assumption made about a   document's "structure" was that it would probably   have a Title of some sort.&nbsp; References to specific numbers,   colors or geographic locations may be blindly treated the same as   every other word in the document.&nbsp; (See also Entity   Extraction.)&nbsp; Hopefully, if a term appears in the title, it will   be given a bit more weight, but that's about it in the basic   world of documents.</p>
<p>Fulltext searches are also much more free form. Think about how   much easier it is to type a search into Google, verses creating an   old-school SQL SELECT statement.</p>
<p>But Enterprises DO have data, lots of it, and it is often   structured.&nbsp; And yes, they have millions of textual documents   too.&nbsp; Enterprise search is often called upon to search across   both textual documents and database records, and often as part the   same user's search.&nbsp; Most modern engines support this   type of hybrid search, and in many cases fields can be used to filter out   extraneous matches and focus in on a particular set of results.</p>
<p>Some companies have content with both textual content and hundreds   of "fields".&nbsp; For example, imagine a parts database   for the airline industry.&nbsp; There would be descriptions of the   parts, plus lots of meta data concerning part size, manufacturer,   materials, applicable aircraft model, inventory levels, etc.&nbsp;   Note that, in the document-centric world, fields are referred to as   "meta data" or "attributes".&nbsp; A mechanic   may want to search for "landing gear brackets" for the   Boeing 747, made out of titanium, and that are less than 5 years   old.&nbsp; This calls for a hybrid search, and possibly faceted   navigation.&nbsp; (More on that later.)</p>
<p><small><a href="#top">[back to top]</a></small> <a name="tech"></a></p>
<p class="h4">Technical Differences between Internet and Enterprise Search</p>
<p>Here in Part 1, we'll focus on the "easier"   technical differences.&nbsp; We've broken them into "User   Experience" at the high and low level, and a section on data   and spidering issues.</p>
<p><small><a href="#top">[back to top]</a></small> <a name="uihigh"></a></p>
<h3>User Experience: High Level</h3>
<p>As we've said, the way users interact with a corporate   search engine may be quite different than the casual use of Yahoo and   Google on the web.</p>
<p><small><a href="#top">[back to top]</a></small> <a name="singleshot"></a></p>
<p class="h4">Single Shot Relevancy ??? Over-Reliance in Both Markets</p>
<p>Long time readers will recall that we've warned before that   an over-reliance on "relevance" can belie a flawed usage   assumption, that ANY engine can find the "correct" answer   for the typical 1 or 2 word search.&nbsp; On the Internet, when I   type "bush", how could the system know with certainly   whether I'm referring to President George Bush, junior or   senior, or the Australian outback, or one of the many beers or   musical groups with "bush" in their name (with or   without that exact spelling), or perhaps a shrub to plant in the   yard.&nbsp; In the enterprise, terms like "resource" or   "schedule" are similarly ambiguous.</p>
<p>Ironically, this first issue is something public and private   engines often have in common.&nbsp; Which leads us to???</p>
<p><small><a href="#top">[back to top]</a></small> <a name="navigators"></a></p>
<p class="h4">Enterprises Often Need Faceted Navigation</p>
<p>Data in the enterprise often has more meta data, and can therefore   allow users to drill down into search results; some   vendors call this parametric search.&nbsp; We're talked about   these terms in previous articles.</p>
<p>If the docs lack meta data, but are at least organized in some   type of overall logical order, then a taxonomy might work.</p>
<p>If the content is completely unstructured, a   sometimes-acceptable alternative is to use unsupervised   clustering, but we usually view this as a workaround ??? if   you have good meta data (or database fields), or at least some type   of overall rule-based organization, faceted / parametric navigators   or taxonomies will usually give more pleasing results.</p>
<p><small><a href="#top">[back to top]</a></small> <a name="secretsauce"></a></p>
<p class="h4">Google Relevancy Trick "Broken" Behind the   Firewall</p>
<p>This isn't to say that Google's code is buggy, not at   all!</p>
<p>But Google's main improvement years back, on their public   Internet portal, was to consider all the links to each web page in   their ranking calculations ??? pages that were referred to by   more sites were presumed to be more authoritative, and were therefore   given a higher score.</p>
<p>This is sometimes called "organic linking", in that   nobody controls the public Internet, and people   frequently link from their web site to other sites based on their personal   opinions.&nbsp; If you plotted all of these links on a graph, it   might look a bit chaotic, like thousands of little roots or   tentacles, but it really did give a decent approximation of   human-determined "goodness" for each page.&nbsp;   We're seeing a resurgence of this with blogs linking to other   blogs.</p>
<p>But within corporations and agencies you don't have millions   of users randomly creating links between pages, based solely on their   personal preferences.&nbsp; Instead, the links between web pages   inside a company are more orderly, and tend to approximate a logical   org chart of sorts.&nbsp; It may seem more orderly, but   it actually encodes less human-derived wisdom.</p>
<p>Thus, when the Google Appliance indexes data on a private network,   it doesn't have the same advantage that it does on the public   Internet, and therefore performs more on a par with other commercial   search engines.&nbsp; It's not "bad", it's   just not amazingly better than other guys.</p>
<p>Of course Google realizes this, and we suspect they have been   trying to tweak their algorithms to compensate.&nbsp; And of course   there are SOME links on company Intranets, and some employees do   cross link pages.&nbsp; But in search engine industry insider speak,   they are put back on the same "TF/IDF" playing field as   everybody else. (See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TFIDF)</p>
<p><small><a href="#top">[back to top]</a></small> <a name="web20"></a></p>
<p class="h4">Web 2.0 Techniques Not Directly Applicable</p>
<p>Social networking, "wisdom of the herd", blogs, the   "user" as "man of the year".&nbsp; If you   read any web or search related publications, you're very   familiar with all these terms.</p>
<p>These trends have been used to enhance search on the World Wide   Web, social networking sites, and leading ecommerce sites.&nbsp;   Google's link ranking could even be considered an early form of   this trend.</p>
<p>But these techniques have not worked as well on private   networks.&nbsp; There are a bunch of technical reasons which we will   detail in a future article.&nbsp; But here are a few examples:</p>
<p><small><a href="#top">[back to top]</a></small> <a name="tagging"></a></p>
<p class="h4">Tagging</p>
<p>This is where users add descriptive keywords to documents, photos   or video.&nbsp; The search engine looks at these tags for future   searches.</p>
<p>Of course in the enterprise, where there are typically more documents   than photos, and documents already have text, so this doesn't have   as big of an impact.</p>
<p>But more importantly, on a public web site with millions of   visitors, even if only 1% of them add tags, that's tens of   thousands of users adding tags on a regular basis.&nbsp; In a company   with 1,000 employees, that same 1% equates to only about 10 employees   adding tags.&nbsp; They will certainly tag some important documents,   but whether or not they've flagged the best document to match   the search you're running at the moment is far less likely.</p>
<p>So directly applying tagging "as is" in the enterprise   isn't as likely to make a big impact.</p>
<p>However, this method could be re-designed to be more   effective.&nbsp; On public sites like Flickr or YouTube, users make a   specific decision to add tags to a photo, we call this Explicit   Tagging.</p>
<p>In the enterprise, when users type in search terms and then click   on a document in the results list, they are still telling you   something about the document they selected.&nbsp; They typed in some   terms, and at least the title of the document led them to believe   that it was related.&nbsp; There is a mild implication that this   document is related to the search terms.&nbsp; We call this type of   automatic tagging, based only on results list clicks, Implicit   Tagging.</p>
<p>It's not a perfect replacement.&nbsp; When they opened the   document, they may have realized that it was NOT they wanted, and   then quickly closed it.&nbsp; They might open up 5 or 10 documents as   the result of a search, and all of those documents would be   implicitly tagged with the same search terms, so this dilutes the   value of the association.</p>
<p>You could imagine systems that try to work around this.&nbsp;   Perhaps there's some way to time how long the user has the   document open, before they close it, the implication being that the   longer they had it open, the more interesting it was.&nbsp; Of course   if they left it open because they got a phone call, then that too is   a false assumption.&nbsp; Or perhaps you make a stronger association   between the search terms and the first document they open, and give   less and less weight to subsequent documents that are opened.</p>
<p>None of these implicit tags seem as good as the classic Web 2.0   explicit tags, where the user goes out of his way to tag a   document, and gives some thought to which would be the best   terms.&nbsp; But it's still likely better than no tags at all,   if you're a fan of tagging in general.</p>
<p>We've even proposed to clients that they implement BOTH   Explicit and Implicit Tagging, and give much higher weight to the   classic explicit tags.</p>
<p>But the point here is not about tags, it's that a Web 2.0   technique needed to be rethought and modified for enterprise   search.&nbsp;</p>
<p><small><a href="#top">[back to top]</a></small> <a name="blogging"></a></p>
<p class="h4">Blogs</p>
<p>Another example is the strong weight given to blogs by public   search engines.&nbsp; Terms that suddenly appear across many blog   entries are likely to be about a new subject or event, and therefore   can be given preference.</p>
<p>But what if your enterprise didn't have any internal   blogs?&nbsp; Some companies have even banned employee blogs.&nbsp;   Instead of thinking about "blogs", perhaps your search   engine could pay more attention to the text of newly submitted bugs   and technical support requests.&nbsp; The idea is to give preference   to the data sources that track what's new and what people are   talking about, a class of applications called Lightweight Publishing   (LWP).</p>
<p>Again, the point is not whether or not bug reports should be   treated just like blog entries, but the fact that this is another   search related Web 2.0 feature that may need to be re-thought before   applying it to Enterprise Search 2.0.</p>
<p><small><a href="#top">[back to top]</a></small> <a name="ids"></a></p>
<p class="h4">Identities</p>
<p>Speaking of Blogs, an aspect of Web 2.0 that may be superior in the Enterprise 2.0   search space is that of assured identities.&nbsp; On a public web   site, you don't always know who might be posting comments or   spam, or perhaps accidently spreading incorrect information.&nbsp;   But in the enterprise, most employees have a validated login.&nbsp;   An employee's contributions can be tracked, corrected, or   perhaps even rewarded.&nbsp; Going further, the search engine can   also look at the employee's job title and geographic location   to automatically add additional context when ranking results.</p>
<p><strong>It's All About Re-Tooling</strong></p>
<p>Re-tooling Web 2.0 techniques to   fit Enterprise Search is so important that we plan to do a dedicated article on the   subject in an upcoming issue.&nbsp; Please email us if you have   interest in this topic or would like to be interviewed.</p>
<p><small><a href="#top">[back to top]</a></small> <a name="clients"></a></p>
<p class="h4">Different Specialized Search Clients</p>
<p>We mentioned the abbreviation WPIWPO (Web Pages In ??? Web   Pages Out) in the opening section.&nbsp; On the Web Pages OUT side of   things, there are many types of search applications in the enterprise   that do not involve a user sitting at a workstation using a generic   web browser and search form.</p>
<p>Enterprise users have lots of uses for search results.&nbsp; Here are some   examples of how a hypothetical enterprise might employ search in   other ways:</p>
<ul>
    <li>
    <p>The Call Tracking system that Tech Support uses to log incoming   calls could call out to a search engine to look for a resolution, and   present the results directly back into CallTrack.&nbsp; It could even   copy the problem description, by default, into the search box.&nbsp;   And if a tech support rep finds an appropriate FAQ or bug fix, they   could "link it" to this call with a single mouse   click.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
    <p>A paralegal might use a custom application to search over many   different legal databases, some internal, some on the web, and some   involving premium subscription-only content.&nbsp; If pertinent items   are found they could be linked into the case, or flagged for further   review by a senior partner.&nbsp; And whenever a result is cited, a   PDF snapshot could be automatically captured and logged, including   case number, the paralegal's employee ID, the date and time,   the data source of the cited record, and the search terms used.&nbsp;   The paralegal could return to this case file at a later time, or   collaborate with other employees on larger cases.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
    <p>A company could leverage the natural language processing and   entity extraction features of a search engine to track trends in   overall search activity and newly added documents.&nbsp; Instead of   performing specific searches, this BI system is used to spot shifts   in behavior or interest, and to spot new statistically significant   vocabulary terms.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
    <p>The IT department might decide to use the search engine to run   simple reports, instead of using the traditional relational   database.&nbsp; This trend is referred to by some vendors as   "database offloading".</p>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>And even just considering web interfaces???</p>
<ul>
    <li>
    <p>The researches in R&amp;D might be very sophisticated search users   and they might want a more detailed search form, with lots of fields,   date ranges, zone searches, etc.&nbsp; The same corporate search   engine can expose different search forms to different users.&nbsp;   Casual users get a simpler form that looks more like the public   Google home page.&nbsp; Whereas more experiences or specialized users   get a more complex form with lots of options.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
    <p>Or suppose HR would like a web search form for their   department's homepage, that just searches through HR policies   and procedures.&nbsp; In the old days, they might have gone out and   bought their own search engine.&nbsp; But now, they can have their   own custom search form, living on their department's site, that   still uses the central search engine's horsepower.&nbsp; And   the form sets a filter, as a hidden field, that restricts to the   search to just the HR URLs.&nbsp; To a user, it looks like HR has   their own search engine which just searches the HR policies, but on   the back end it's just another web form using the main search   engine.</p>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>We'll try to give more examples in an upcoming article.</p>

<h3>Federated Search</h3>
<p>If a company has multiple search engines installed,   an employee looking for something could visit   each search engine separately and run the same search.&nbsp; But this   is very inconvenient.&nbsp; It would be much more efficient to give   the employee a single search form to enter terms into. Then that   search is submitted to all of the engines simultaneously and the   various matches are combined back into a single results   list.&nbsp; This is what Federated Search attempts to do, and has   garnered quite a bit of publicity lately.</p>
<p>However, most of the demos of Federated Search only show search   results combing back from multiple public search portals.&nbsp; For   example, a search is submitted to Google, MSN and Yahoo, and the   results are stitched back together in some way.&nbsp; While this is   handy for public search, it falls far short of what true Enterprise   Federated Search would need.&nbsp; Some vendors do realize this and   are adding additional features.</p>
<p>Examples of features required for Enterprise level Federated   Search include:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Flexible rules for combining results from all of the engines     searched</li>
    <li>Maintaining Users Security Credentials</li>
    <li>Mapping User Security Credentials to other security     domains</li>
    <li>Advanced Duplicate Detection and Removal</li>
    <li>Combining results list Navigators, such as Faceted Search links     and Taxonomy Nodes.</li>
    <li>Handling other results list links such as "next     page" and sort order.</li>
    <li>Translating user searches into the different search syntaxes     used by the disparate engines.</li>
    <li>Extracting hits from HTML results, AKA "scraping",     hopefully without the need to custom code.</li>
</ul>
<p>We've explained these in more detail in the Sidebar   "Advanced Federated Search Functionality.</p>

            <p class="h4">Sidebar: Characteristics of Federated Search in the Enterprise</p>
            Here we explain, in a bit more detail, about what those Federated Search bullet points actually mean.  As always, email us if something's not clear.  <small><a href="#top">[back to top]</a></small> <a name="fed_merge"></a>
            <h3>Flexible rules for combining results from all of the engines     searched</h3>
            <p>At the most basic level, there should be various options for how   the results from remote systems are combined.&nbsp; In some cases,   users might need a single, simple results list, with matches from all   engines mixed in, and properly calibrating the different relevancy   scores.&nbsp; In other cases, when it's too hard to compare   relevancy scores from vendor A and vendor B, it might be better to   present the top few results from each under a separate heading or in   a separate tab.&nbsp; Other vendors may offer a simple "round   robin" approach to combine results.</p>
            <small><a href="#top">[back to top]</a></small> <a name="fed_sec_keep"></a>
            <h3>Maintaining User Security Credentials</h3>
            <p>Maintaining the user's security credentials across all of   the systems being searched.&nbsp; So if I logged in to my corporate   SSO as smith, then my jsmith SSO session ID needs to be passed   through to all of the search applications that are SSO-aware.</p>
            <small><a href="#top">[back to top]</a></small> <a name="fed_sec_map"></a>
            <h3>Mapping User Security Credentials to other security     domains</h3>
            <p>Mapping the user's security credentials to systems that have   separate logins or security domains.&nbsp; For example, though the   SSO system knows me as jsmith, my login for the old Lotus Notes   system might be js1234.&nbsp; And my subscription to premium content   on LexisNexis might be under john.smith@acme.com&nbsp; The Federated   Search system needs to handle this mapping automatically and   seamlessly.</p>
            <small><a href="#top">[back to top]</a></small> <a name="fed_dupes"></a>
            <h3>Advanced Duplicate Detection and Removal</h3>
            <p>The Federator should be able to spot   duplicate results returned by more than one engine.&nbsp; This is   relatively easy to do if search results always have a comparable   URL.&nbsp; But sometimes the document key from each engine has a   radically different format.&nbsp; Imagine, for example, that my CMS   returned a match, with a document key of   "DOC_OBJECT_<strong>45678</strong>".&nbsp; My corporate Google   Appliance had also spidered the CMS data, and found the same key, but   only has a URL key of the form   "https://cms.corp.acme.com/ViewItem?view=7272&amp;object=<strong>45678</strong>&amp;session=a492bc79184ef18"</p>
            <p>Clearly both engines have returned the same document, but the   federator would need to transform at least one of the document id   tags before doing a comparison.&nbsp; And even if all that were   handled, there's still the question of which of the duplicates   to show and which to get rid of.&nbsp; Suppose one of the matches   was a report written by one of my coworkers, from our own CMS.&nbsp;   And suppose that same article were also returned by a premium content   provider we subscribe to, where if I click on it to read it, my   company will be charged for accessing that document.&nbsp; Clearly it   would be better to show me the version from our CMS engine for free,   rather than the premium content, so business rules need to be applied   when decided which duplicates to keep or toss.</p>
            <small><a href="#top">[back to top]</a></small> <a name="fed_facets"></a>
            <h3>Combining results list Navigators, such as Faceted Search links     and Taxonomy Nodes.</h3>
            <p>Yet another challenge for Enterprise class Federated Search is   combining results list navigators.&nbsp; We've said before that   engines should not just rely on Single Shot Relevancy, that users   should be given clickable navigators in the results list so that they   can "drill down" into the section of matches that are   more interesting.&nbsp; Suppose a Federated Search returns thousands   of results to a user query, and that search engine A returned   clickable facet navigators of "White Papers",   "FAQ's" and "Corporate Library", and   that search engine B returned taxonomy branches of "Sales /   Northeast", "Sales / Midwest", "Marketing /   Press Releases / 2007" and "Engineering / Bug   Reports".&nbsp; It would be really difficult to combine these   into one coherent list of clickable choices.</p>
            <p>But let's consider an even simpler example.&nbsp; Suppose a   Federated Search is run against two different "parts" databases in my   company, perhaps System A shows matches from our North American   electronic components inventory, and System B has aircraft parts   stored in our European warehouse.&nbsp; Let's assume I do a   search for "bracket", and both systems return thousands   of results.&nbsp; And, let's make the navigator facets align   more closely, and say that BOTH systems included facets for   "Material = Aluminum".</p>
            <p>That would certainly be an easier set of navigators to combine. We   can take the 350 aluminum brackets from System A and the 75 aluminum   brackets from System B and show a unified clickable facet.&nbsp; The   facet's header will be "Material", and one of the   hyperlinked choices listed underneath will be "Aluminum   (425)".&nbsp; Notice we've even combined the counts, 350   from System A and 75 from System B. &nbsp;That all looks fine, but   now???</p>
            <p>What happens when a user actually clicks on that navigator?</p>
            <p>Navigators are typically rendered as hyperlinks, with CGI   parameters tacked on.&nbsp; If you moused-over that link, you might   see a CGI parameter somewhere in the URL of the form   ???&amp;<strong>material=aluminum</strong>&amp;???&nbsp; But that link points   back to our Federator, and it has to remember that those <strong>425</strong> were   actually <strong>350</strong> matches from System A and <strong>75</strong> matches from System   B.&nbsp; The good news is, this is theoretically possible to handle,   and instead of "remembering" that this represents results   from two systems, the Federator will likely just reformulate two new   queries, one for System A and one for System B, both of which have   the additional "material=aluminum" filter.&nbsp; But this   is still a really complex system.&nbsp; And perhaps System A calls   this attribute "material", whereas System B calls it   "primary-alloy".&nbsp;</p>
            <p>Just for fun, suppose System A   uses the common name "aluminum", whereas System B uses   the chemical formula from the periodic table, in this case   "Al".&nbsp; Obviously not every system is this   complex!&nbsp; But the point is that an industrial strength search   federation engine would need to have a plugin for rules concerning   navigators, and those rules would need to allow for predefined   mappings of facet names and values.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>To date, no search or   federator vendor seems up to this challenge, or they would   "well, you'd write a custom plugin to handle   that".&nbsp; A fair answer, but a far cry from the snazzy   public demos and easy configuration showing federation of results   from Amazon, Flickr and Yahoo.&nbsp; We believe the companies who are   really pushing Federation as their primary product need to include   more configuration options to handle scenarios like this without the   need to break out a Java or C# compiler.</p>
            <small><a href="#top">[back to top]</a></small> <a name="fed_nav"></a>
            <h3>Handling other results list links such as "next     page" and sort order.</h3>
            <p>Another type of results list navigation link which can get   complicated in the federated model are the "next page" /   "previous page" links.&nbsp; If I'm showing you   combined results from four different search engines, what should   happen when you ask to see the "next page" of   results?&nbsp; There are answers to this question, of course, but   they are not always trivial.&nbsp; Allowing users to change the sort   order of results has similar technical challenges in a federated   environment.</p>
            <small><a href="#top">[back to top]</a></small> <a name="fed_syntax"></a>
            <h3>Translating user searches into the different search syntaxes     used by the disparate engines</h3>
            <p>Another challenge for high end federated search are the different   search syntaxes used by the various systems that are to be   searched.&nbsp; Using the previous example of looking for an aluminum   bracket, all the user has done was type in the word bracket into a   search box, and then drilled down by clicking on the   "aluminum" facet.</p>
            <p>On the back end, this needs to be translated into the native   syntax for each engine.&nbsp; For example, assuming 3 back end   engines, the native syntax might be:</p>
            <dl>   <dt>Autonomy/Verity K2 US Parts Database using VQL:</dt>    <dd><code>'bracket' &lt;and&gt; material=aluminum</code></dd>    <dd>&nbsp;</dd>    <dt>European Oracle Parts database:</dt>    <dd><code>SELECT * FROM PARTS WHERE DESCRIPTION LIKE '%bracket%' AND
  ALLOY='Al'</code></dd>    <dd>&nbsp;</dd>    <dt>And perhaps a third system using Ultraseek:</dt>    <dd><code>bracket || material:aluminum</code></dd> </dl>
            <p>Most vendors refer to this as Query Transformation.</p>
            <small><a href="#top">[back to top]</a></small> <a name="fed_scrape"></a>
            <h3>Extracting hits from HTML results, AKA "scraping"</h3>
            <p>And a final hurdle, some of the remote engines being searched will   just return simple HTML.&nbsp; The Federator needs to parse the   results list, to pull out the actual documents; this is often called   Screen Scraping.&nbsp; Although most vendors would support writing a   custom plugin in Java, C# (or maybe Perl/Python), it would be better   if there was some type of configuration language that made it easier   dissect the HTML results, without the need for coding.&nbsp; For   example, our own XPump language includes various high level pattern   matching extractors.</p>

<p>As you can see, this is an incredibly complex topic.&nbsp; The   simplistic demos using only public data sources that most vendors   show don't even begin to scratch the surface of real Enterprise   Federated Search level capabilities.&nbsp; And when the answer to   every tough question is "well, you could write a custom   plugin/connector to do that" and other vague hand   waving;, it means that quite a bit of this complexity will be   your responsibility to figure out, or may add lots of dollars to your   "Professional Services" bill.&nbsp; We're not   saying "don't do it!", if you really need federated   search it IS possible; we're just suggesting that you keep your eyes   wide open, and ask LOTS of question after they show you their   Flickr/YouTube federated demo.</p>

<h3>User Experience: Lower Level Differences between Internet and   Enterprise Search</h3>
<p>This section focuses more on the low level "bits and   bytes" and behind the scenes technical issues that ultimately   impact what the user sees.&nbsp; If you get these wrong it   won't be directly noticeable to your uses, but they will tend   to NOT find what they are looking for, and continue to claim that   "search sucks".</p>
<p><small><a href="#top">[back to top]</a></small> <a name="thes"></a></p>
<p class="h4">Vocabulary and Thesaurus</p>
<p>Finally some good news!&nbsp; Virtually all enterprise search   vendors support some type of custom thesaurus capability, and often   this provides the biggest "bang for the buck" in terms of   minimal effort and greatly improved results.&nbsp; A related feature   would be the search engine's spelling suggestion system.</p>
<p>Within a business or agency, there is typically a much narrower   vocabulary in use than that of the public Internet.&nbsp; And there   are typically "domain experts" within the organization   that know all about the custom terms and abbreviations commonly   used.&nbsp; Since companies control the search engine, they also have   access to search activity logs, which can be another source for   finding common search terms and misspellings.</p>
<p>A frequent problem with search, but one that can be detected and   fixed, is Vocabulary Mismatch.&nbsp; This is where the subject   experts and authors of the content are using one set of terms, but   casual searchers are using a different set of terms.&nbsp; Perhaps users   are not aware of important abbreviations, or    misspell a word, product name, or model number.&nbsp; One abandoned   idea is to educate the users to use the correct terms ??? this is   rarely practical.&nbsp; Another basic fix is to get the content   authors to use some of the same terms that users use; this works   sometimes, assuming you have control over the content, and the   resources to update older content.&nbsp; But things like common   abbreviations and acronyms used within an organization are so   pervasive, you're never going to catch all of them, and a   well-maintained thesaurus can easily fix these problems.</p>
<p>We do remind clients to periodically compare their thesaurus with   their search activity logs; terminology certainly changes over time,   either due to recent events or new product launches, etc.</p>
<p><small><a href="#top">[back to top]</a></small> <a name="monitor"></a></p>
<p class="h4">You Can Monitor "Performance"</p>
<p>More good news.&nbsp; If you own the search engine, you can also   monitor its response time, usage patterns and search activity much   more closely.&nbsp; In modern, well functioning search engines, your   users should get back results in a second or less the majority of the   time.&nbsp; If, on the other hand, you're seeing searches   routinely take more than 2 seconds, or heaven forbid, more than 5   seconds, it's time to call IT or the search engine vendor.</p>
<p>And as we have pointed out before, great Search Analytics starts   with great search activity data logging.&nbsp; You have a lot more   control about the level of detail that gets logged (and possibly   greater liability!)</p>
<p>In business, the quicker you spot problems, the quicker you can   fix them!&nbsp; Contrast this with the search on the public World   Wide Web.&nbsp; Unless you work for one of the big portal companies,   there's not much you can directly do about problems that you   spot.&nbsp;&nbsp; You can blog about it, or rant about it in   your Enterprise Search Newsletter, but that presumes that somebody at   the portals is actually listening.</p>
<p><small><a href="#top">[back to top]</a></small> <a name="syntax"></a></p>
<p class="h4">Search Syntax May Be Different</p>
<p>On the public Internet, advanced users who want to tweak their   search results can edit their query and resubmit it.&nbsp; Most   modern engines on the web understand the plus sign (+) to mean   "required", and the minus sign or hyphen (-) to mean NOT   or "exclude".&nbsp; Many engines also support the colon   (:) to indicate a field or zone search, for example title:California   might be interpreted to mean "search for the word California,   but only if it appears in the title"&nbsp; In addition to advanced   users, programmers sometimes use this syntax when automatically   generating complex queries in custom search applications.</p>
<p>Most enterprise search vendors have adopted similar query parsing   rules, although this is not universal, and there are some subtle   differences.&nbsp; Most vendors also have a more syntax rich native   language, which may look a bit more like SQL.&nbsp; But unlike SQL,   there is no standard syntax shared by most vendors; standards have   certainly been proposed, but not widely supported.</p>
<p>Vendors vary more widely in terms of how Boolean operators are   expressed, or whether sub-queries can be nested inside of   parenthesis.&nbsp; For example, the Google appliance supports both +   and the word AND, the older Verity formal K2 VQL syntax was   &lt;AND&gt;, and Ultraseek used | and || (single and double vertical   bars).&nbsp; That last one is not a typo!&nbsp; Unlike C-derived   syntax, which equates the vertical bar with "OR",   Ultraseek used that character to mean "AND", more   reminiscent of the Unix pipe command.&nbsp; It's not important   that you remember this, unless you're a search consultant.   The point is that it can vary widely between vendors.&nbsp; This is   an issue that developers working only with one or two public search   engines may have never faced.</p>
<p>A more subtle difference has to do with the default Boolean   operator.&nbsp; On the public Internet the "implied"   Boolean operator is typically an "AND" if you type in   multiple search terms.&nbsp; Whereas Enterprise search engines may   default to an OR when searching for multiple terms, and this policy   can sometimes be overridden.</p>
<p>An asterisk (*) may invoke a wildcard search but not always,    there may be restrictions or configuration changes required.</p>
<p>Case sensitive searching is supported by some vendors, but not by   others, or may require additional syntax to specify.&nbsp; For   example, my first name is Mark, but the generic word   "mark" can also be as a noun or verb in English.&nbsp;   Some engines would allow me to search for just "Mark",   and ignore the lowercase version; other engines do not.&nbsp; By   default, most engines are case-insensitive (they ignore differences   in upper and lower case).&nbsp; A few engines change their default,   depending on whether they see both upper and lower case letters in   the search.</p>
<p><small><a href="#top">[back to top]</a></small> <a name="punct"></a></p>
<p class="h4">Punctuation may be an important part of the actual Search   Terms</p>
<p>People using public search engines don't usually worry about   punctuation.&nbsp; But enterprise users and technically savvy   customers may need to lookup specific model numbers or error messages   that include lots of punctuation.&nbsp; An engineer might think to   include such a term inside of double quotes, but even that   doesn't work on all search engines.&nbsp; And imagine a company   with a part number designation of XY-420; customers and documentation   might refer to that as XY420, XY 420, Xy 4.2.0, or perhaps they own   an "XY-420a"; correctly matching model numbers and   version numbers can be particularly vexing in some   applications.&nbsp; Even tougher, clients have even told us about   customers copying and pasting error logs and stack traces directly   into their site search box.&nbsp; Chemical equations, units of   measure and mathematical symbols might also be critical to some   specialized search applications.&nbsp; Other classic examples are how   to properly tokenize and search for things like PS/2, AT&amp;T and   X.25.</p>
<p>There is a rather long explanation for the different ways this can   be handled, often depending on which vendor/engine is being used,   and there may be some overlap with Entity Extraction.&nbsp;   It's too much to cover here.&nbsp; But suffice to say, if you   have a search project where punctuation is important, it is not safe   to assume your search engine will handle it correctly.&nbsp; This   will require some research and thorough testing to insure proper   operation.</p>
<p><small><a href="#top">[back to top]</a></small> <a name="dupes"></a></p>
<p class="h4">Control over Duplicate Detection and Near Duplicates</p>
<p>For various technical reasons, duplicates are almost never   identical, but still perceived as a duplicate by a   casual human observer.&nbsp; Of course there can be "false   positives", documents that appear very similar at first glance,   but which are in fact actually different, and both of   importance.&nbsp; So even now, we're left with computers trying   to guess which things are really duplicates, verses which things are   actually different.</p>
<p>&nbsp;There is a related problem with detecting duplicates when   using Federated Search, see the sidebar.</p>
<p>Most public Internet search engines play very fast and loose with   duplicates.&nbsp; More than ten years ago, public World Wide Web   search engines started erring on the side of "perception"   ??? if two things would look like a duplicate to a user,   it's best to remove one of them, sort of "When in   doubt, throw it out!"&nbsp; Users complained loudly about   duplicates cluttering up the results list, and in those fiercely   competitive days, portals didn't want to lose   "eyeballs" so they complied.&nbsp; And the portals   figured that, even if a few non-dupes were accidentally tossed out, users   would never know!</p>
<p>To be fair, this was market driven, and some public search portals   such as Google even give you option to see of the results, dupes   and all.&nbsp; It's not the default, but if you want to see them,   you can.</p>
<p>But this is in drastic contrast to the situation many companies   face.&nbsp; Imagine a law office that uses boilerplate contracts with   many of its clients.&nbsp; The text will tend to be very similar, but   every contract is important, and you certainly don't want some   computer randomly guessing which documents to ignore - there could be   dire legal consequences for such computer chicanery.&nbsp; Yes, in   this specific situation, there are technical solutions to address it,   assuming anybody thought to ask.</p>
<p>Or imagine a software company with a mature product line that has   gone through 10 major revisions over the years.&nbsp; Each version   came with revised instruction manuals in PDF and HTML.&nbsp; To a   computer, some of these versions are likely to seem almost identical,   especially for chapters covering features that have not changed that   much.&nbsp; But for somebody working in Tech Support or QA at this   company, you would not want the computer to start randomly guessing   which version to show them; they most likely want the most recent   version or a list of available versions.&nbsp; But   what they probably don't want is for the engine to quietly show   them the version from 5 years ago.</p>
<p>Returning to our law firm scenario, imagine that upon discovering   that duplicates were mistakenly discarded, the firm decides to just   turn off the duplicate detection in their search engine, better safe   than sorry!&nbsp; But this could cause other serious problems.&nbsp;   For example, a web page on their Intranet might be referenced by more   than one URL.&nbsp; The company holiday schedule might be referenced   as <a href="http://corp/holidays">http://corp/holidays</a>, <a href="https://corp/holidays/">https://corp/holidays/</a>, <a href="http://corp/holidays/index.html">http://corp/holidays/index.html</a>,   and <a href="http://corp.acme.com/holidays/index.html">http://corp.acme.com/holidays/index.html</a>&nbsp;   If many of the pages on their network had 3 or 4 URLs, turning off   duplicate detection could dramatically impact search results for the   worse, and make all employees substantially less productive (and   aggravated).&nbsp; Again, in this scenario, there are probably ways   to configure the search engine properly handle both issues, to remove   duplicates that are simply caused by different versions of the same   URL, while still ensuring that all copies of customer contracts are   properly returned.&nbsp; But somebody will have to understand these   issues, talk to the vendor or consultant, and then test the   configuration changes.&nbsp; It's not rocket science, but it   may not be "trivial" to fix either, and this is something   that a casual public Internet search user might never have   encountered.</p>
<p>You can see that the problem is not only detecting which things   are really duplicates, vs. which things are almost duplicates, but   also then deciding which version should be show by   default.&nbsp;&nbsp; And you might want to give the user additional   indications that other versions do exist.</p>
<p><small><a href="#top">[back to top]</a></small> <a name="sec"></a></p>
<p class="h4">Different Security Requirements and Infrastructure</p>
<p>On the public World Wide Web, there's not much of a   connection between security and search.&nbsp; You may have logins for   certain web sites, and you may use https when buying something with   your credit card, but that doesn't have much to do with a   general search that you might do on Google or Yahoo.&nbsp; Yes, a few   subscription sites limit what non-subscribers can see, or may require   an account to read the full text of a document.</p>
<p>But as we've mentioned in previous articles, and in the   section on Federated Search above, inside the enterprise security can be heavily tied to   search.&nbsp; In larger organizations, your   company login may be used to restrict which documents you can see in   the search results list.</p>
<p>Generally speaking, the security infrastructure and protocols tend   to be different between the public web and the enterprise; and when   security is needed in search, the search engine must integrate with   the available security infrastructure and protocols.&nbsp; The Internet   and Intranet both use SSL and HTTPS.</p>
<p>On the web, newer systems are evolving to allow for electronic   payments, so for example you can use PayPal on many different   sites.&nbsp; The SAML standard, based on XML, is becoming more widely   adopted.&nbsp; And there is evolving the general concept of "distributed   identity assurance".&nbsp; A participating site could verify that I am   a California resident, for example, without requiring me to create a   new account on every site that needs to know that.</p>
<p>But on private networks, Single Sign On (SSO), LDAP and Active   Directory are still the norm.&nbsp; A search application that cares   about security will likely be using those protocols.&nbsp; A few   enterprise apps still use the older "application level   security"; search engine applications can do likewise.&nbsp; We   haven't seen the distributed identity assurance model taking   root in corporations yet, they still seem to prefer a tightly   controlled central resource.&nbsp; One exception to this apathy is   between different government agencies; they are starting to realize   that government employees frequently need data from other agencies,   and that distributed, cooperative security systems make this much   more efficient, so that government employees don't have to keep   creating new logins for every agency they visit.</p>
<p>There are additional security related items to consider when   dealing with Federated Search, see the Sidebar.</p>
<h3>In Our Next Issue???</h3>
<p>In our next installment, we'll finish up the technical   differences between Internet and Enterprise search, with an emphasis   on the source data that is to be searched, and the spiders and   connecters that are creating the search index.</p>

<p>We'd love to hear from you.&nbsp; This is a very broad   topic, but your projects may be concerned with a few key areas, so   drop us a line!</p>
