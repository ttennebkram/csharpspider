============

Spider/Crawler written to debug sites and TRACK LINKS.

It's annoying when a spider says there was an error fetching a page
but doesn't say what page that bad link was on!

It's written in C# C-Sharp

To get started you probably want:

* ```branches/new-dev/installer/NIE_Spider.msi```

TODO:
* I think trunk vs. new-dev branch should be swapped
* Not sure of doc
